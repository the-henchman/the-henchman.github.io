    <li><b>PlaineSundial</b> - a static web app that aims to produce images of sundials as vector graphic
        image files (SVG-files).
        <ul>
            <li>
                This app can be used to design a dial a bit like <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@59.9393234,10.7225347,3a,90y,40.07h,113.92t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s30Nu4hECgfMRmc9wlBaZ7g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-23.92%26panoid%3D30Nu4hECgfMRmc9wlBaZ7g%26yaw%3D40.07!7i13312!8i6656?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEyNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank">this</a>

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Gnomon</b> -  a stick at right angles to the dial that throws a shadow onto the dial in sunlight. The
                dial is read at the tip of the gnomon's shadow. The gnomon should be placed at the intersection of the bar
                and the stem of the little blue <span style="color:blue">T</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Style</b> - a more elaborate version of a gnomon for better readability. The app draws the style
                to fit the dial. The green line of the style should be vertical with its base at the blue <span style="color:blue">T</span>.
                Its blue baseline is to be aligned along the stem of the <span style="color:blue">T</span>. A guideline
                for aligning the style runs through the style-base marks.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Style-base marks</b> - two small blue dots (<span style="color:blue"> . . </span>) on opposite
                        edges of the dial. The base of the style is aligned with the line through these points.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Truncated style</b> - a triangular style may become very long for some dials. It is better to
                        truncate it by cutting away the part that never throws shadow onto the dial. To get a full style,
                        extend the top and baselines of the truncated style until they intersect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Style model</b> - a design to print, cut out and glue together. This will form a sturdy style
                        that can be glued to a print of the corresponding dial. The result will be a testable model dial.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>Static web application</b> - All processing by this app is done in the browser, there is no processing
                done by a server
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Project name</b> - a name to reference the input while storing and retrieving it. The name will also be a
    part of the filename for downloaded fies.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cookie</b> - a small piece of data stored in the browser</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Geographical position</b> - the position of the dial on the surface of the Earth.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Latitude</b> - degrees north or south of Earth's equator. Prefix with N for northern latitudes, S for
                southern.
                Range of values from S90 (South Pole) to N90 (North Pole)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Longitude</b> - degrees east or west of the Greenwich meridian. Prefix with E for eastern longitudes,
                W for western.
                Range of values from W180 (international date line) up to but not including E180 (international date
                line)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Horizontal orientation</b> - how the dial is oriented with respect to the horizontal plane. This is obtained by
        measuring the dial plane's normal, represented by the gnomon. Imagine the gnomon extended until it touches the
        firmament in a point P. Imagine a point Q on the horizon directly below P.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Azimuth</b> - the horizontal angle of the gnomon, measured along the horizon from geographical north and
                eastwards to point Q. Values from 0° up to but not including 360°.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Altitude</b> - the view angle between points Q and P, positive if P is above Q, negative if below . From
                -90°(nadir) to 90°(zenith).
            </li>
        </ul>
        These values should be as exact as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Astronomical constants</b> - the Earth is moving around in its yearly path, but the numbers that
        describe this path are slowly changing over centuries. A sundial cannot be valid for all times, one must choose a year
        in the middle of the dials assumed lifespan and use the values for this year as constants.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Span of hours</b> - suggests a span of hours for the dial to display. 7 hours is recommended for a dial on a
        vertical wall. This way there will be some overlap in time displayed between dials around the four walls of a house.
        No input value indicates that the dial should display the largest hour-span possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Minimum altitude above dial</b> - as the Sun moves near to the plane of the dial, the gnomon will throw a very
        long shadow. This is akin to the long shadows of the afternoon. To limit the size of the dial, it is necessary
        to set a lowest altitude angle for the sun above the dial
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Hour-lines</b> - straight lines used to mark the hours and parts of hours. The full hours have their hour
        number associated with them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Timezone meridian</b> - the geographic longitude of the meridian determines the timezone of the dial
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Same as longitude</b> - i.e. geographical longitude. The dial will display local solar time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Multiple of 15°</b> - closest to the geographical longitude. This can be used in most cases. The dial
                will
                display zone solar time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Offset to GMT</b> - the difference between zone clock time and GMT in hours. May be positive or
                negative. The dial will display zone solar time. Places whose timezone does not equal the timezone
                of the closest timezone meridian should specify this offset, as for instance places with year round
                daylight saving time
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Day line</b> - A line describing the daily motion of the sun. The set of day lines represent the Sun's motion along the ecliptic
        through the year. Day lines representing solar ecliptic longitudes that are multiples of 30°, may be marked with
        the conventional signs of the zodiac, or with abbreviations of the names of the signs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Clip with horizon</b> - The tip of the shadow of the gnomon will never fall above the horizon line. The part
        of the dial above the horizon-line will be clipped away if this option is enabled. Not clipping may contribute
        to better readability.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Horizon line</b> - a dial that is not to close to horizontal, will have a straight <span style="color:red">red</span> line
                representing the horizon.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Horizon marks</b> - two small red dots (<span style="color:red"> . . </span>) on opposite edges of the dial. The line through these
                        points should be parallel to the horizon.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Display the Equation of Time</b> - The EoT makes it possible to obtain the approximate clock time from the dial.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Minutes of EoT may be marked to the closest minute or the closest half minute. Better precision would be futile.
                The number of parts of EoT may be entered by the user or selected by the app if left empty.
            </li>
            <li>
                The tip of the shadow will always fall between a pair of colored lines, one <span style="color:#00FF00">green</span>
                and one <span style="color:orange">orange</span>. Follow these lines to either end where a signed number
                is written between them. This is the current EoT in minutes. The green value at one end is the EoT for
                the spring half of the year, the orange value at the other end is the EoT for the autumn half year. Interpolate
                the hour-and-minute values between the hour-lines and add the appropriate EoT to this value. The result
                is the clock time.

            <li>
                <b>Spring half year (<span style="color:#00FF00">green</span>)</b> - the time from the winter solstice

                <b>Summer solstice</b> - For northern latitudes: when the Sun reaches the tropic of cancer. For southern
